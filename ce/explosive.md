This plugin contains a custom enchantment effect that allows you to use 5 different types of explosive effects:

* Explosive
* Excavation
* Sphered
* Disk
* Tile

This was originally included in TokenEnchant plugin.  However, it has been removed from TE itself so that this effect can be used in the different version of TE.

### Demo Video:
coming...

### Installation:
Just install TE-ExplosiveEnchant.jar in TokenEnchant/enchants folder. Then you can either "restart the server" or "reload the plugin (not /te reload)". ExplosiveEnchantment will automatically be loaded into TokenEnchant framework.

### Configuration:
You need to add new entry for "Explosive, Excavation, Sphered, Disk, and Tile" enchant under the "Enchants:" section in your config.yml.

#### NOTE:
* Make sure to configure your WorldGuard (block-break : allow) or if your server uses any region management plugins, make sure they allow users to break blocks in the region where you wish to use this effect.
