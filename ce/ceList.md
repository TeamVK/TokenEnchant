# Custom Enchantments
There are two types of Custom Enchantments (CEs):
* Enchantments : these CEs are created based on Minecraft's Enchantment.
* Potions : these CEs are created more like Minecraft's Potion effects.

In practice, the codings for these two types of CEs are slightly different but the usages are pretty much the same.

### Obtaining 
If a custom enchant has its own website, you can follow the link to obtain it.  
Some custom enchantments might not be free.  
Custom enchantments created by TeamVK (vk2gpz and ThePurpleHoser) can be obtained from the URL provided, or you can create an order request ticket at [TeamVK's support site](http://vk2gpz.freshdesk.com).
